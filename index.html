<h2>PAS Legal Document</h2>

<div id="pas-legal-raw">
Greetings Bosch
I created this blog JUST FOR YOU! But anybody can see it (it's not private). It pertains to what happened in 1996 when I was teaching at Coachella Valley High School in the valley of the same name, in the city of Coachella and/or Thermal, near Indio, Palm Desert, & Palm Springs. It is the poor end of the valley with mucho (many) Latino immigrants. My classrooms were 95% Latino, maybe more.

How Did I End Up in Coachella?
I had never even heard of Coachella in July of 1994. As you may recall, I did my student teaching at Holland Christian Middle School with Bob Kool. I also passed the Michigan state general & subject exams for my preliminary teaching certificate (in Michigan). And of course, I passed the departmental exam (not too difficult).

Summer in Jackson, Wyoming
Following that semester of student teaching, I went to Jackson, Wyoming ("Jackson Hole") where my late aunt Martha had a home with her husband Warren (both Calvin alums). Jackson is the gateway to the popular Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Parks. Martha is from the Leo Peters family, a name you probably know. But not all descendants of Leo Peters agreed with his theology or politics. Nobody should assume that knowing Leo Peters means knowing his children or grandchildren.

The Teaching Opportunity
At the time I arrived in Jackson - planning to stay for the summer, I was actually getting ready to be a missionary teacher in Hungary in association with the CRC/CRWM. But at some point I got a call from a friend named Jim (also Calvin alum) who had been teaching for a year in Coachella. He knew I had just finished my English/education degree and told me they were looking for a new English teacher at the same school he had been teaching at for the past year. So I ended up going there and talking to the principal (Bill Connell, a former Air Force commander turned-principal) and Bill offered me a job. I said sure, why not (sorry I'm not trying to use perfect English grammar here with all the perfect punctuation—just trying to make my case for you).

What Bill Didn't Tell Me

What Bill did not tell me when he offered me the job was that he was retiring in a few weeks. He did not tell me there would be a new principal when I started my first day as a regular teacher. My first job as a regular teacher. This would be significant as it turns out.
