9.9.24 - 10.4.25


 Monday 9.9.24 Atherton, San Carlos, San Mateo, S. San Fran, good trial run. Tuesday  9/10/24 gas in redwood: averaged $4.12 ; saved $16. Also EV on the ATM street ! keep it going. The ATM gave me a $100 bill. Strange. I had go to the teller to break it down into 20’s . I thought the default was $20 dollar bills if you don’t specify. Nobody takes $100 dollar bills. Or try not to. Especially small stores etc. 9.11.24 Wednesday sss Mt Carmel church redwood , good ! san carlos library again, okay  Xcept one guy, Belmont library crazy kids. One kid on sidewalk crying. I was about to help but some other good samaritans helped her before I could park and walk over to help. Better if a female helps another female anyways, especially if they are teens. This was right next to the high school as they were getting out for the day. Redwood Shores library very nice . & big. Spacious. I thought it was going to be the little one by the water that I went to many years ago but this was something else. Now at Burlingame library - tiny carrels on top. Slept. Thursday Sept 12 2024 sss nice church 8am in Burlingame. Millbrae library great ! printed T-Ev’s ! Now at S. San Fran lib again. It’s a beautiful new facility. Very well done. And did my 1st-ever T-mustard EV ! sleep. Watched “Romancing the Stone” 1984) for the 1st time, prompted a braB rebuke poem . also a gnilbis rebuke poem ! Epoh Wen! Friday the 13th of Sept 2024 sss into Daly City, more EV at lib. From the 13th to the 19th of Sept I stayed in the City of SF, x-several at St. Ignatius, Ev At St Ignatius , also piano flower at Botanics ! nice. DeYoung Art, Legion of Honor Art, Golden Gate band at GG park. Exploratorium, pf pf pf pf pjpjpjpjpjpj, also Marina Branch Library, Presidio LIbrary (rude fellow), West Addition LIbrary (no parking lot anymore; not a nice place anymore) leaving SF Thursday the 19th sept 2024 , sleep Mill Valley  745 am church mill valley, 10am library mill valley, 12 noon drove to Limantour Parking lot to hike to Sculptured Beach . THis is the city of Point Reyes Station, I think. HIgh tide at noon, so we arrived at the perfect time. We should get to the scenic spot at low tide. Start walking. It’s only 2 miles each way.  Beautiful beach. Very few people out here in this remote area. Arrive around 130. Very nice. All to myself. I explore & crawl & climb. And take some pic/vids. And just as I am leaving, I see a few whales not far off the coast. I watch for a while, and hold up my camera hoping to see them come up again- and suddenly one of them breaches ! And my camera was rolling. What a thrill. And I keep the camera rolling and he breaches x2 more ! Unbelievable. Thank you Lord. ! Walking back a couple ladies ask me if I went to the “crater” . I didn’t know about the crater. I looked it up later. A little bit beyond sculptured beach is a interesting geological construct called the crater. Kind of cool. Maybe I will do that next time. Got gas in San Rafael for $4.39 ! That’s a hopeful sign. So I filled it up because I want to also reset my ECU (electronic control unit) because it will turn off my CEL (check engine light) so I can renew my registration. Because I combine E85 with regular the engine light will come on indicating the wrong fuel mix and will stay on until I return to regular. It won’t hurt the engine (so I’m told, and never has after several years) and it saves me several $100 per year on gas (because E85 is so much cheaper). 


 Friday the 20th  of Sept 2024  sleep San Rafael, prayers for prisoners at San Quentin, across the Richmond bridge. 8am St. Cornelius church is almost 100% Hispanic, and priest speaks only Spanish. I go over to the Richmond Civic Center- 1st time at this library. Neat little spot. Leaving there I go to El Cerrito library, and pull the ECU fuse, so that when I return and put it back in the CEL will be off & the ECU will be reset. However, this also means the computer needs time to “relearn” various things. IN my case, or in my vehicle’s case, or  in my experience I should say, it will entail stalling periodically until it completely resets. The relearning process apparently is normal for all cars , but I’m not sure about the stalling like it does in my case. From El Cerrito library to North Branch Berkeley library (my intended destination) it stalls numerous times. I finally stop, sit and wait , and start praying feverishly (GIG, TYL, naboj icadooh, pf menlo lady,  Prayer really helps me, and helps ! I have various prayer recitations. And I also pray-on-paper , this helps me stay focused, and also helps when I look back on my prayers how God always comes thru ! absolutely, 100%, always. For some reason my phone won’t connect to internet either. So as I am parked at Santa Fe & Marin Ave,  across from Marin Elementary School in Albany CA,  I call my provider, & talk to somebody in the Philippines,  and they do a refresh, and it comes back on after 15 minutes. After 30 minutes I restart my car and it drives perfectly fine to a different library: Berkeley West Branch (on university Ave near Curtis) . several hours working on Prayer Book at the library. THen sleep. Prickly pears. 9.21.24 Saturday sss Stanford upset Syracuse last night, Friday game. 8am car starts ok. I let it idle 10 minutes as recommended. Start driving intending to make it to St. Ambrose church for 8am mass. And i make it no problem. But St. Ambrose doesn’t look very open, no cars, - so I keep going. Now heading towards Cal University, and up a little hill it stalls. This is the first hill I’ve encountered. I guess it needs to relearn hills too. I coast into a parking spot and sit for a while. I restart and change my destination to North Branch library. My main concern is that too many restarts may wear my battery down without a long highway drive. PJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJ. Good spot at north branch. I remember this little library. Evigrof em, Evigrof em. I find it good to also repent at times like this. Maybe , no not maybe, but surely I have committed some sins of omission or commission that displeased God over the last few days or weeks and repentance will hopefully also reset my relationship with God and others and return me to a pleasing state of grace. Forgive me God x 100. 


START NEW BOOK ! 


9.21.24 CONT praying for mss-v mss-v x400, PJ PJ PJ PJ x100, tally marks x300, evigrof em, at library in Berkeley 8:12 as CTCTCTC, twilaBD, Ecarg, THinking “ I’ve never had a prolonged period of stability & regularity in my life since FTS” . Every 2 years is the “smog drama” re my car- ; several times I had to use BAR to scrap one vehicle and search for a new one. Now it’s happening again. It’s always some ambiguous CEL about mass air flow sensor or map sensor etc. Could be a vacuum leak, etc. the car was running so good but I had to get the CEL off to pass smog. I thought it was on just because I mixed E85 with regular; and usually it would go off when I go back to just regular gas. THis time it didn’t go off. So I pulled the ECM (aka ECU) fuse for 30 minutes and then put it back in . This was at El Cerrito Library. Immediately as I started driving it acted funny, then stalled. I should have let it idle for the first 10 minutes even though I haven’t done so before. Nonetheless, I made it to the next library ( in Berkeley) and after a few hours drove away; but every day for the next 7 days as you will see in the following log, it has been intermittently stalling, sometimes not starting or re-starting,etc. Although it always seems to start again if I wait an hour or so. THat’s a lot of fun when you’re trying to get things done. But it’s taught me to pray more and be more patient because I have no choice, not because I am so virtuous. ECarg ecarg ecarg, TYL, drove to St. Jerome for 830 but it looked closed. Did i get the time wrong ? There’s also a St. Ambrose. AM I confusing the two? 840 stall on hill. I figure this is normal relearning going up a hill. I coast to a parking spot and wait and pray 10 minutes, 855pm at 1000 Oaks & Colusa in Berkeley, stall again, waited 15m. Re-start *& idle 10m until 905, PTL PTL PTL x1-00, Synch: “It is well with my soul” , mijnil, PFO, repose repose repose AmeriPrayer, unborn, 3bu, EV, Pmurt, POTUS Sutop, PJPJPJPJPJPJPJ TYL, to get me to Cal, made it to north branch lib & stalled 911, total 9miles so far, Now Sunday 9.22.24 sss slept n branch, awake 6 am, there was a party last night nearby- very loud as I was trying to sleep . Then somebody lit off a cherry bomb too, sounded huge, like an explosion. Hadn’t heard one of those in a long time. It rocked the neighborhood. Twilabd wisdom, HMPL, no re-start, sounds bad so I am starting the relearning process all over again. Pull the fuse again. Here we go. Starts ok. 25m idle. 655, pray [ray pray, Yarped all night too, Icadooh, JIL, AAA, Evigrof em, TYL, BOSLWSPEGG, px5 922 Sunday 9.22.24 , 2 more minutes, Try again PJ PJPJPJ, started again, reverse a few inches forward a few inches little by little ; 726 stalled again , modsiw, modsiw, PJPJPJPJPJPJPJ reverse stall, try again, there’s the lady with the 2 goldens, So I’m just going back & forth- the berkeley people think I’m nuttier than a berkeley nut. 2 circles on THe Alameda . px6 Hopkins Ave, driving 748 no stall yet.

TYL TYL TYL never never. NBCA tnecalpmoc , 2nd gear & drive to Hello Bagels, San Pablo & Martin ave 818 am, Long stretch in drive to Albany Square, made it to  TIre Choice- they said I could get my battery recharged at Azone or Oreilly - he thought they would charge it while it was in my engine but he was wrong. They require you to bring it inside. Problem is getting my battery out- requires special tools , Oreilly’s CEL scan says Maps Sensor p107, “low voltage” . hmm. Px8. so many re-starts I’m wondering if my battery is getting low, so I call A-Zone Guy named Isaac (i thought) said he could take it out for me so  I drive over there and he pulls it out. He smelled like marijuana and said to me “Make sure you remember where everything goes” apparently not too confident in his own memory. SO they start charging it and I walk over to mcdonalds to get some change actually so I can tip this guy. I buy a coke to get some change for a $20. THen I stroll thru the goodwill across the street- on San Pablo Ave. THen I stroll back to A-Zone. THe battery is ready. The other employee says he will put it in. Isaac seems disconcerted about it. But it is what it is. THis guy insisted. I give Isaac a tip nonetheless. The other guy puts the battery back in. Meanwhile, suddenly one of my 2 phones is missing. I can’t find it. Can’t figure it out. I never lose them. Never. THey don’t see it inside the store. I walk back to mcdonalds and goodwill and ask them if they had found it. Nope. back to the car. I’m about to leave without my other phone (which I use for pics and videos etc. Dejected, I’m about to leave but i have one last hunch: check the engine area. And sure enough, there it was - down by the radiator fan. Did I set it on the edge and then one of the workers knocked it in? Or did it fall out of my shirt pocked without me noticing ? There was a lot of commotion for a few moments with three of us working on the battery area at the same time. I go back in the store and ask if they have a tool i could use to reach the phone (too slim of an area for my arm to reach). They do. Nice enough of them. Anyways, the removal of battery is another “reset” and re-learn has to start again. But back at NB area , it doesn’t sound good so I have to remove the fuse once again. Start the re-learn for a 3rd time.. or 4th ? unbelievable. So much drama. TYL TYL TYL. sputtering after reset but this time seems to relearn faster. Maybe. Need to resume shutterfly tomorrow , looked up maps 107, px10 . Is my hunch right, or am i being hard-headed, above my paygrade ? I don’t think i need a new map sensor.

What a stupid mistake by that young stanford student. She tried to sit on the table which tipped and everything fell off it, including my laptop and jacket which I had carefully set there. She didn’t even apologize or bother picking it up. I had to disrupt everybody to scoot past the narrowly packed row to go pick up my laptop . she just stood there with a stupid look on her face. Miracle it still works ok. That’s the good news. The bad news is  3 stalls , rough idle, and rattle after lecture. Now it’s saying “reduced power” (limp home mode) . giving it gas won’t rev it up. IT’s supposed to protect the engine. So I sit by Cartier and the Apple store for 90 minutes. When I return the car starts fine. This is the new normal. Nothing predictable. Was the high heat causing it ? 95 degrees? Shouldn’t be. Or does it have to relearn different weather and temps too ? PTN: Hurricane Helene is devastating Florida and other parts too. 530 x3 to start - now i get the rumble and it sounds terrible. New noise .

When I restart the CEL is off again. Good grief. At 7am I go to laundromat (Martha’s Laundry), afterwards, i get the REP light again. CEL back on. This is crazy. Call for tow truck. But they take so long I finally try to re-start and it’s fine again. Cancel tow. Bad experience at MT View Auto Repair. Sickening. Un-freakin-believable. The roller coast drama continues  pause px28  the washer was leaking water on to the floor at Martha’s Laundry. I told another guy about it and he acted like a jerk. Well, I began by saying “Do you work here?” because he looked like an employee - maybe that angered him I don’t know. THere’s no offense in being a laundromat employee. So I finally decided to just get towed to a auto repair shop so I called Good Sam my tow service (short for Good Samaritan) and they said “Felix” was on the way. But after 2 hours he still wasn’t there. I started the car and this time it was running ok. Good grief. The drama continues. I cancel the tow and called Mountain View Auto Repair and asked if they could check it out. THey did a job for me a few years ago. They are Chinese, and a little greedy but I hoped they would be honest with me. The Chinese guy makes sure to tell me it’s $120 to diagnose. That’s steep and normally I would look around but it’s so unpredictable I don’t know how far I can go. So I finally pull into Mt. View Auto REpair at 845 W. El Camino Real 94040 and give a little honk to announce my arrival and the Chinese guy comes to my car window. I repeat the problem and now he tells me he cannot help me. Px29 it’s clearly racist discrimination. You could see the snobbery in his eyes as he looked condescendingly at my vehicle- which is actually a good, solid vehicle but a few things need fixing up. But the aesthetics should NOT MATTER A SCINTILLA . This guy is simply a racist jerk , a bigot, and a xenophobe. If I was Chinese-American I am sure I wouldn’t be turned away. I didn’t argue with him but I did file a complaint against the business with a California board  in Sacramento. THey will be interviewing me on January 6 2024.

And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 3No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 4They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 5There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.,,,px36… 18I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. 19And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll…

friday the 11th of october 2024 ANOTHER BIG DAY  PP redwood pause , smog 1 $59 this was the big bad day . good & bad, did he deceive me ? we’ll find out. Next door mechanic ordered crank case breather hose, waiting at atherton library for a call from the mechanic saying the part has arrived , praying to pass smog, meanwhile I just found out my long time twitter X account has been hacked . what the heck is going on ?> I can’t log in . I try twitter x help and they say they don’t recognize my email. I notice they sent me a warning a few days ago (that I missed) about somebody logging in to my account from Ohio, and then the next day , from Texas. What the heck ? it’s very upsetting as I sit at atherton library still waiting for a call from the mechanic. So I’m doing my best to try to upload material to twitter X help to show them it is definitely MY ACCOUNT not this hacker in ohio or texas. Nothing’s helping so far. Then some asian dude comes in to the library and frantically looks for a place to plug in his laptop - my laptop is already plugged in to the one and only outlet. I try to be helpful and point to the other plug but he will have to sit in a different chair 2 steps away. He refuses and seems to expect me to jump up and plug my laptop in to the other outlet because my cord will reach that far. But just as easily he could simply take 2 steps and sit in a different chair (of the same type) and easily plug in. If he won’t compromise, why should I ? He’s being a jerk. Suddenly he angrily  pulls out my plug and plugs in his own laptop. Totally unreasonable and in defiance of all library etiquette let alone simple rules of society. It was like an act of road rage. Like somebody just blew their top at a car in front of them for sitting at a red light. THe car can’t just blow the red light to make you happy . You can’t expect somebody to just jump up and plug in elsewhere if you yourself won’t even make an effort to sit in a different chair where you could plug in yourself. I can’t push somebody out of a chair in a library where I want to sit, just because I want that specific chair. It’s ridiculous. I wave to the nice female employee behind the kiosk and she comes over and tries to intervene but it’s not going so well. I ask for the manager and a few minutes later a nice gal named Mary comes out. She asks my name and his name (Ken). she listens to me tell my side of the story. Then she asks Ken his side of the story. He admits to all of the above. I am thinking he should be kicked out. He’s not even apologetic . Mary rebukes him at first. THen I add that I might have accommodate him but I was also uploading something at the moment. He shook his head and called me a liar “No you weren’t “ and then he adds “dude “ or something. Now he’s trying to denigrate and insult me and call my character into question. I can’t believe it. I say to Mary “I deserve to be treated with dignity and respect like anybody else. I’m 57-years old, not some young punk. “ she nods as if she’s in agreement. I tell her I’m too upset to stay. She offers to help me find another seat but doesn’t seem willing to make Ken leave, apologize, or sit elsewhere despite him being the aggressor, and me the victim. It doesn’t even make sense that I should be expected to jump up and plug in my laptop at outlet B simply because he refuses to take 2 steps to plug in his own laptop at outlet B. AND then he insults me like a racist. WE’ve never met. He knows nothing about me. He knows nothing about what I’m doing on my laptop. As mentioned I’m working feverishly trying to get thru to Twitter X to get my account back- one that I’ve been using since 2007. It’s unbelievable. I ask Mary to “get his name” and she says she did get his name. I meant his official ID - so that  this could be a little more official. ANd I repeat that he should be kicked out. I”m packing up my stuff . I start walking towards the door and add that “He had instant hate for me” - this was more than just a matter of plugging in- he had an instant superficial hateful generalization about me based on some negative stereotype he had in his head. Very sickening and uncalled for . I did nothing wrong. I’m a good person & good citizen and educated - also in good standing at church. Everything good and positive. I don’t deserve to be mistreated. Even if I was not a good person. But I am. I add “NO HATERS HERE” as I exit to the outdoors. A white lady looks over at Ken & Mary still there as I leave. Not sure what happened after I left. I hope Mary perceived the truth of the matter. I hope she didn’t just try to whitewash the matter . But it’s obvious they do not know what to do when a “minority” has a moment of “road rage” in the library. THey don’t have a protocol for how to handle an angry out-of-control patrol. If it had been me as I mentioned earlier in the conflict, I would undoubtedly have been quickly kicked out. But because it’s a so-called “minority” and the staff is mostly white they don’t know how to handle it. All their training is that it’s whites or especially white males who are the angry ones. But it was just the opposite here. The California training that still teaches this paradigm of the angry white male ignores the fact that the white male and whites in general are no longer the majority in CA. We are not the majority. WE are the minority. And all minorities or “persons of color “ are not all little darlings, not all little angels, not all innocent and perfect. They need a paradigm reconfiguration for a new century, or at least 20 years after the turn of the century. THey need to integrate the new statistics and reality into their paradigm. The older white males are all retired and homeowners who may occasionally venture into the library. But i’m not one of them. I’m not that old, not retired, not a homeowner, and still need to use the library for it’s resources . I’m not angry. I’m not angry at minorities. But I don’t expect to be abused by them either. I don’t deserve to be abused by minorities. I’m a good person. I deserve to be treated with respect & dignity like anybody else. END ATHERTON LIBRARY .

Why did he skip this ? ha ha as he stands up there in a long robe himself, and sits in the seat of honor, etc  “38 As he taught, Jesus said, “Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, 39 and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. 40 They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.” Mark 12 instead he only read the 2nd half of the passage about the poor widow who threw in a few pennies “43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.” FASCINATING MOMENT that the priest skipped half the passage.

Planned parenthood jacksonville at university & powers, said a prayer at High-noon. HMPL. another synch immediately: i’m listening to a podcast about the movie “Argo” (or Argo story re Iran hostage crisis) and I look up and see an “Argos” factory in j=-ville near the PP i just drove by. God affirmed it . made it all the way to Macclenny from Orlando without turning off the car - which turned out to be a good thing- because it barely started after I took a rest at the rest area. I need another new starter- the third in 3 years. Stopped in at mechanic. He checked the battery. Good. he confirmed it is the starter. Started calling around. No warranty. Buy new one at A-zone $200 in macclenny FL . Found mechanic to do the work tomorrow- called Spradleys near Lake City. Hopefully it will start one more time to get me there. Slept in Macclenny - took a walk to the nearby library. Father and daughter chatted with me about abraham lincoln and slavery. Interesting conversation. 1/29/25 wednesday sss made it to spradleys- across from a salvage , and not far from Olustee Battlefield ( “The Battle of Olustee or Battle of Ocean Pond, was fought in Baker County, Florida, on February 20, 1864, during the American Civil War. It was the largest battle fought in Florida during the war.” )- the owner spoke with a strong southern dialect . the mechanic worked alone - but his wife or girlfriend occasionally appeared to help him  as he was working a a head gasket. Waited about an hour- then he got to work on my starter. Nice enough young fellow. Knew his stuff. Worked fast. Says he’s a disabled marine veteran - was in the iraq war.  Didn’t see any noticeable disability. Did his job well. Just a bit unkempt, that’s all. Paid $100 for the labor. So i’ve bought 3 starters in 3 years. The first was $150 -and got warranty on replacement. This was $200- that makes $350 for parts, and about $300 for labor. 3 years $600 total. Hopefully this will stay good for more than another year. Starters should last much longer. The 1st 2 were remanufactured from O’reilly’s . THis is brand new- all new from A zone -which I don’t usually like to shop from (because they support PP). But did so because of the situation . PTL ! on the road again. There’s Olustee Battlefield- and a fire tower. Famous civil war site. Also this is by prisoner row- lots of prisons in this area.  And ocean pond. ..osceola National forest, auto REpair Auto RePrayer, blog ? whitehouse .gov apply for press credentials- including bloggers.

Passed by the  natural bridge battlefield - not much to see there. They say it is the site of the “2nd largest Civil War battle in Florida” - i think i was at the 1st largest a few days ago near Lake City (Olustee) (not much to see there either).

The tire is going bad. Didn’t realize it- but suspected it a few days ago. Forgot to check. So I actually am able to slice thie loose piece of rubber off with a razor blade as traffic whizzes past. I decide i better not go over the bridge in case the tire totally fails. So i pull off next exit. Find a walmart- sit there for a while. Do some shopping. Not the nicest walmart. No self-checkout.

Signs warning against trespassing dot the shoreline, reminding everyone that wading or boating is technically prohibited.More troubling is what’s hidden beneath the surface. The waters have submerged storage sheds containing fertilizers and chemicals, manure piles, electrical wires, and sharp farm machinery.These hazards not only pose risks to anyone venturing into the lake but also raise environmental concerns about contamination.” https://www.earth.com/news/ghost-lake-tulare-returns-after-130-years-and-buries-94000-acres-of-farmland/

When the light turned green I proceeded forward and then paused a few seconds so I could enter the flow of traffic safely and with the intent of making a legal u-turn at the upcoming intersection with another traffic signal (cambridge & ECR) (the only way to go south on ECR ) . As I paused the drive behind me honked loud and long. I was waiting for an opening- then I proceeded. In the next few feet on ECR he gunned the gas and passed me to get in the u-turn lane in front of me. It was ridiculous. Now he was in front of me waiting for the signal to make a u-turn (remember this is 8am- the day is just starting- strange for somebody to be so impatient and angry already). So this time I honked at him.  Apparently this angered him so much that he opened his door and I saw his right arm rise up- I ducked instinctively- not knowing if he had a gun or what. Turns out he had a bottle and he threw it at me. Luckily, it was an empty plastic water bottle, but still ! I will also report this to police. The driver had some sort of head covering. I got his plate and took a picture. Later I looked up the vehicle (2023 polestar).

It has been restored and reinstalled in its original location on the west front fountain plaza of the museum. “Calder Foundation, which maintains the authoritative archive of his work, estimates that he produced over 22,000 individual works”

So, Alger Elementary effectively became Alger Middle School with the construction and opening of the new building in 2006….While I don't have a definitive list of the exact elementary schools that took in Alger's former elementary students immediately after 2006, the primary elementary school that serves the general Alger neighborhood area, and is closely associated with it, is Brookside Elementary…Brookside Elementary students are actually slated to move into the renovated Alger Middle School building in the future. This move, originally planned for 2027-2028, has been pushed back to 2028-2029. This means the building will once again house elementary students, just under a different school name (once again Alger Elementary) …Students from Alger Middle School will be moved to Strong Middle School and Riverside Middle School…”, unbelievable moment as I’m leaving Calvin Campus a mama deer with 4 fawns on a front yard (Lake Ave) 

Re “ Miller's Ice Cream Parlor

Miller's Ice Cream Parlor, located at 739 Burton St SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was a cherished local establishment known for its classic ice cream offerings and nostalgic ambiance. While specific opening and closing dates for this particular location are not readily available, the original Miller's Ice Cream business was founded in 1896 in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, by Dennis Miller. The company expanded to operate approximately 30 ice cream parlors throughout Michigan and Indiana. After Dennis Miller's passing in 1953, the business continued until it closed in 1985 .(99wfmk.com)

The Grand Rapids location at Burton and Eastern was a beloved spot for many locals. As one Reddit user fondly recalled:

“Went to church across the street from it. On Wednesdays we would walk to church and then on the way home we would stop at Miller's. G me memories.” “The building that housed Miller's Ice Cream Parlor has since been redeveloped, and the original establishment is no longer in operation. However, the memories and fondness for Miller's Ice Cream Parlor continue to live on in the hearts of those who frequented it.”

“ synopsis of the French and Indian War:

“Who Fought: Great Britain and its American colonies, along with Native American allies (notably the Iroquois Confederacy), against France and its Native American allies (like the Huron, Algonquin, and others).

“Outcome and Significance:

British Victory: The war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which saw France cede nearly all of its North American territory east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain, including Canada. Spain, an ally of France, gave Florida to Britain.

Shifting Power: This dramatically altered the map of North America, making Great Britain the dominant European power.

Seeds of American Revolution: While a victory, the war left Great Britain with massive debt. To help pay for it, Britain began to impose new taxes and stricter policies on its American colonies (like the Stamp Act and the Proclamation of 1763), which led to growing resentment and ultimately contributed to the American Revolution.”


Yough marine & lake,Youghiogheny  River & dam * ohiopyle “Youghiogheny River, often called "the Yough," is a 134-mile-long river flowing north from West Virginia and western Maryland through the Laurel Highlands of Pennsylvania, eventually joining the Monongahela River. The name "Youghiogheny" comes from a Native American word meaning "a stream flowing in a contrary direction."

The river played a role in early American history. George Washington explored the river corridor in 1754 while seeking a passage through the Allegheny Mountains.” The word "Ohiopyle" is derived from the Lenape (Delaware) phrase "ahi opihəle," which translates to "it turns very white" or "white frothy water."

For Keller, the positive fear of God is not about being scared that God will harm or punish you (especially for those who are in Christ), but rather it's a profound sense of awe, reverence, and joyful respect for His immense glory, power, holiness, and love.”

Update “On August 4, 2023, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed House Bill 2426 into law, officially ending the state's 72-year-old ban on self-service gas. This change makes New Jersey the only remaining state with a full-service-only law.

However, the new law is not a complete switch to self-serve. Instead, it creates a "hybrid" model with different rules depending on the county's population.”

However, no widespread, significant damage occurred globally—most of the destruction was localized to parts of Kamchatka and Severo‑Kurilsk, and there was roughly $1 million in damage to the Crescent City harbor in California, with minimal impact elsewhere” I was in Crescent city on 7.27.25. Three days later they got hit by tsunami causing $1 million in damage ? “A floating concrete dock called H Dock was lifted off its pilings, jammed, and eventually submerged. Although it was designed to fail in this manner to protect the rest of the harbor, that failure incurred heavy damage
⚡ Utility Infrastructure

Extensive damage occurred to the embedded electrical conduits, including exposed live wires, ripped potable water lines, and fire suppression plumbing lines throughout multiple docks
🌊 Sediment & Debris Deposition

The surge deposited large volumes of sediment and debris throughout the harbor basin. This resulted in shoaling within navigation channels and berthing areas, which will require dredging to restore proper depth and access for vessels”

Vod “boast not against the branches  but if thou boast thou nearest not the root but the root thee” Meaning of the verse:

Paul warns Gentiles not to be arrogant toward Jewish people who have not yet believed.


If Gentiles are now part of God’s people, it’s not because they are better, but because they were grafted in by God’s grace.


The root (God’s covenant and promises) supports them — they don’t support the root.


In other words: You don’t give life to God’s plan; God’s plan gives life to you.

Vod “if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy, & if the root be holy , so are the branches” Main point:

Paul emphasizes that holiness and salvation flow from God’s plan and promises, not from human merit.


Gentiles, grafted into the olive tree, share in the blessings because they are connected to the holy root and the holy firstfruit (Christ).x

Meaning:

The “first” (the old sacrificial system of the Law) pointed forward but was incomplete.


The “second” (Christ’s perfect sacrifice and the New Covenant) is complete and final.


Christ’s obedience transitions God’s people from the old covenant to the new.

Vod “surely blessing i will bless thee, multiplying i will multiply thee “  “which hope we have as an anchor of the soul” “will bring down high looks” "He brings down the lofty from their seats, and exalts the humble." – Luke 1:52 (paraphrased)

The phrase “will bring down high looks” refers to God’s action against pride and arrogance. “High looks” = prideful attitudes

It literally refers to people who raise themselves up in arrogance or self-importance.


In Hebrew thought, “high” often symbolizes exaltation, whether socially, morally, or spiritually.

Vod “will light my candle” Spiritual illumination

It also signifies righteousness and joy. Psalm 18:28 connects God’s light to life itself: “For it is you who light my lamp; the Lord my God lights up my darkness.”

Then i continued on the loop- stopped at the ice caves hike- that’s very cool and cool near the cave (breeze, and dripping water almost like rain), slipped inside scraped elbow, lots of people there. By the “big 4” mountain The name “Big Four” actually refers to just one peak — Big Four Mountain near the trailhead by Verlot, WA.

The “Big Four” is famous because of the Big Four Ice Caves at its base.


The other peaks I mentioned (Glacier Peak, Cadet Peak, Mt. Pugh, Del Campo Peak) are nearby or visible along the Mountain Loop Highway, but they are not part of the “Big Four” name….The name “Big Four” comes from four prominent rock pillars or knobs on the mountain’s north face.


Early prospectors, miners, and surveyors in the late 1800s and early 1900s saw these four large protrusions and called the peak “Big Four”.

When a government becomes a "terror to good works," it inverts its God-given purpose. In the context of a tyrannical regime like Nazi Germany, the definition of a "good citizen" is twisted. In this case, obedience to the state would have meant participating in, or at least tolerating, a horrific evil.

Many theologians argue that in such situations, a higher moral law takes precedence. The biblical principle of obeying God rather than man, as seen in passages like Acts 5:29 ("We must obey God rather than human beings"), becomes the guiding principle. A "good citizen" in this context is no longer defined by their obedience to the state, but by their obedience to God's command to love their neighbor and stand for justice.” px2 city of Lake Stevens, neg sod: re gb throw away, blocked by pickup with big trailer ; , here’s Pilchuk creek.

U-turn for eagle falls- good decision, miws, rope swing, cliff jumping, father with his boy, strange no parking lines, signs says 12 people have died here in the last decade or so. Not sure why. The river flow isn’t very strong. “Eagle Falls is deadly—even strong swimmers can drown. Rescuers call it a ‘recovery impossible’ zone; violent currents have claimed lives like Devin Shelby’s, never recovered.”


For example, two visitors from Japan drowned after one slipped and the other went in to rescue him—but neither expected how fast conditions can turn deadly AP News.


Sending someone down could mean two deaths instead of one.

Rescuers often mark Eagle Falls as a “recovery impossible” zone. Even with ropes, safety gear, and experience, the hydraulics overpower everything.


That’s why Devin Shelby’s body (and a few others) have never been recovered — not from a lack of will, but because conditions are simply too deadly.

Jesus's response is not a denial of His own goodness or divinity. Instead, it is a rhetorical question designed to make the young man think deeply about the word "good" and the person he is speaking to.

A Challenge to Perception: The young man is calling Jesus "good" in a conventional sense, as a compliment to a respected religious leader. Jesus's question forces him to confront the true meaning of the word. In the biblical sense, true, absolute goodness belongs only to God. By calling Jesus "Good Teacher," the young man may be unknowingly placing Jesus in a unique, divine category.

Revealing God's Identity: Jesus is subtly prompting the man to either recognize His divinity or to admit that he is not using the word "good" with its full, divine meaning. Jesus is essentially saying, "If you truly believe I am 'good,' you must also believe I am God, because that level of goodness can only come from Him."

The Standard of Righteousness: The conversation also sets the stage for a greater theological point. It reveals that no human can be good enough on their own to earn salvation. The young man believes he has kept all the commandments, but Jesus shows him that his heart is still attached to his possessions. This highlights that human "goodness" is always flawed and falls short of God's perfect standard. Salvation is not achieved through human effort but through God's grace.

He emphasizes that he cannot stop, despite the threats against him. It's a statement of determination and purpose, highlighting his commitment to his divine mission.v “ ye hypocrites discern the sky but not the times” Elaboration

In this passage, Jesus is speaking to a crowd and scolding them for their spiritual blindness. He uses an analogy they would all understand: the ability to predict the weather. Just as people could look at the sky and know if a storm was coming, Jesus points out that they should be able to "read the signs of the times."

He is not talking about the weather, but about the profound spiritual moment they are living in—the time of His ministry. Jesus is essentially telling them that they are so focused on the mundane details of daily life that they are missing the most important event of their lives: the coming of the Messiah and the Kingdom of God. He calls them "hypocrites" because they are able to apply their intelligence to earthly matters but refuse to do so for spiritual ones. “Nay, except ye repent, ye shall all perish” POD: i say to myself about the nearby driver “he wants to race”, on the  podcast they also say “he wants to race”  750pm 26west out of portland . good blood, what stadium is that near exit 61B ?

Jeremiah 11:11(NKJV) elaboration: The verse in Jeremiah 11:11 is God’s final judgment on Judah for their disobedience. After repeated warnings, God declares He will bring an inescapable calamity upon them. Their cries for help will be ignored because they are not from a place of true repentance.  Vod:

But for you to be truly complete, you also need to observe the old Jewish laws. You must be circumcised. You must follow the dietary rules. This isn't about salvation, of course.By insisting on rituals like circumcision and specific dietary laws, they could create a system where they were the authorities. People would come to them to be taught, to have the rules explained, and to be judged on their obedience.

As the battle rages, David "grew faint"—a clear sign that his body could no longer keep up with the demands of warfare. In the very next verse, a giant named Ishbi-Benob almost kills David, but he is saved by Abishai, one of his loyal men. After this incident, David's men insist that he no longer go out to battle with them, for fear that he might die and extinguish "the lamp of Israel."  David would have been in his late 60s or very close to 70 years old at the time he "grew faint." The passage highlights that he was no longer a young warrior, but an aging king whose physical strength was finally failing him.” vod: Matthew 14:2, which states:

“And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.” 

In this passage, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, hears about the miracles and teachings of Jesus. He believes that Jesus is actually John the Baptist raised from the dead, attributing Jesus' miraculous powers to John's resurrection. This belief is rooted in Herod's guilty conscience over having executed John, as well as superstitions prevalent at the time. “Ishbibendo , a son of the giant, is thought to have slain David “ OR  Then Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose bronze spear was three hundred shekels, who was wearing a new sword, thought he could kill David.” Ishbibenob, described as a descendant of the giant Rapha, thought to have slain David during a battle where David was weakened. He was a formidable warrior, bearing a spear that weighed three hundred shekels of brass, equivalent to approximately eight pounds, and was girded with a new sword or possibly a new girdle, which may have signified a mark of honor or command. His intention was to kill David, perceiving him as vulnerable, but he was ultimately slain by Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, who rescued David.”  St Mary’s no mass on monday t: aberdeen evk’s , here’s the kurt cobain house (where he lived as a child) , POD: aberdeen, icadooh, 3bu, modsiw, grays harbor college library window exploded while i was there, people wave on campus (must be a policy) , so many old pilings everywhere in the water (remains of docks from the old logging days), Aberdeen Lake cast & miws , also mile hike other park (stewart memorial park ) sleep Tuesday 8.26.25 sss schedule cap1 payment, sleep T, no bother, cloudy morn but supposed to be sunny today VOD:  “if any lack wisdom just ask and it shall be given” “ let the bother of low degree b e exalted” “rejoice in that he is..” “endure temptation shall receive the crown of life” px22 James 1:18 (NKJV):Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.” elab: The verse from James 1:18 is a powerful statement about God’s deliberate and sovereign choice in the salvation of believers.

Then the men of David swore to him, saying, 'You shall not go out with us to battle any longer, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel.'" elab : In this passage, King David had grown weary during a battle against the Philistines, and a giant named Ishbi-Benob nearly killed him. Abishai, David's nephew, intervened and killed the Philistine, saving David's life. Recognizing David's vital role as the leader and symbol of Israel's strength, his men swore to him, urging him not to go into battle again to prevent the potential loss of their nation's guiding light—the "lamp of Israel." This metaphor highlights the importance of leadership and the impact of a nation's leaders on its well-being. David was seen as the beacon of hope and guidance for Israel, and his safety was paramount to the nation's stability. Vod “ the sorrows of hell compressed me, ..the floods of ungodly men made me afraid, the snares prevented me”  vod : “The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.” David vividly describes being surrounded by overwhelming danger and relentless enemies. The “floods of ungodly men” and “snares of death” reflect fear, distress, and imminent peril. Despite this, David turns to God for deliverance, highlighting God’s protection and faithfulness in times of trouble.

The passage you're referring to is from the book of Psalms, specifically Psalm 18. The verses you've quoted are a powerful description of God's response to the Psalmist's distress.

Full Passage (Psalm 18:6-15)
6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, even to His ears. 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the hills also quaked and were shaken, because He was angry. 8 Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth; coals were kindled by it. 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down with darkness under His feet. 10 And He rode upon a cherub, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind. 11 He made darkness His secret place; His canopy around Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 12 From the brightness before Him, His thick clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire. 13 The Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered His voice, with hailstones and coals of fire. 14 He sent out His arrows and scattered the foe, and He sent out great lightnings and routed them.”  Elab: The key message is that when God's children are in trouble, He is not passive. He responds with overwhelming power to save them from their enemies and difficulties. The imagery of smoke, fire, and thunder emphasizes God's majesty and righteous anger against injustice and evil 

the passage is found in both Psalm 18 and 2 Samuel 22. They are nearly identical, with only minor variations in wording. Many biblical scholars believe that 2 Samuel 22 is the original historical account of the song that David sang after God delivered him, and that it was later adapted to be included in the book of Psalms for liturgical or devotional use.

25 With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless; 26 With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd. Elab This passage describes the principle of reciprocity in God's dealings with humanity. It's a profound statement about divine justice and character. The core idea is that God responds to people in a way that mirrors their own heart and actions.” I object  and he says “Grace and Mercy (New Testament): The New Testament, however, reveals a deeper truth about God's character. While He is just, He is also infinitely merciful. Through Jesus Christ, God provides a way for humanity to be reconciled to Him not by our own righteousness, but by faith in Christ's perfect righteousness. This is the essence of grace, where we receive what we don't deserve—forgiveness and salvation—and are spared from what we do deserve—judgment.”vod thou Art my lamp, my strength power perfect, shield of salvation, strength to battle,“Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.” — 2 Samuel 22:45 (KJV)

📜 Context and Meaning
This verse is part of a song of praise attributed to King David, expressing gratitude to God for delivering him from his enemies and establishing his reign. In this context, "strangers" or "foreigners" refer to nations or peoples outside of Israel.

The verse conveys that upon hearing of David's victories and the power of his God, even foreign nations would recognize his authority and submit to him. This reflects the biblical theme that God's favor upon His chosen leaders leads to their influence and respect among other nations.

🌍 Broader Interpretation
While the immediate context is historical, the verse can also be interpreted as highlighting the universal recognition of divine authority. It suggests that God's power and the righteousness of His chosen leaders can lead to acknowledgment and submission from all peoples, regardless of their background or origin.

In verse 18, he clarifies it was three years later that he finally visited Jerusalem.Most scholars understand this to mean that his time of spiritual preparation in Arabia (and possibly part of it in Damascus) lasted about three years in total. What Arabia Meant in Paul’s Day

It included areas of present-day Jordan, northwestern Saudi Arabia, southern Syria, and parts of Israel. Damascus (where Paul also spent time) was under the influence of the Nabataean King Aretas IV (2 Corinthians 11:32). So “Arabia” in Galatians almost certainly refers to Nabataean Arabia, not the whole Arabian Peninsula as we think of it today.

Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.” — Matthew 17:14–18 (KJV)

Vod Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird; the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.” — Jeremiah 12:9 (KJV)   In this verse, God speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, expressing His sorrow over the state of His people, Israel. The imagery of a "speckled bird" conveys the idea of something unique or set apart, yet vulnerable to attack. The surrounding "birds" and "beasts" symbolize the nations and forces that are against Israel, highlighting their isolation and the threats they face. vod “like a lamb to the slaughter, I know not that they had devices against me”—is from Isaiah 53:7–9 “I know not that they had devices against me” — Reflects His innocence and unawareness of conspiracies, trusting fully in God’s plan.

vod I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt. (Isaiah 37:25) The verse you quoted is part of a boastful message from the King of Assyria, Sennacherib, to the King of Judah, Hezekiah. Throughout the chapter (Isaiah 37), Sennacherib is attempting to intimidate Hezekiah and his people by detailing all of his military conquests.

He isn't just stating facts; he's gloating about his power and skill, claiming that he has single-handedly conquered nations, dried up their rivers, and exploited their resources. The phrase "I have digged and drunk strange waters" is a metaphor for his ability to go where no one thought possible and take what he wanted from foreign lands. He takes full credit for his power and success, and in doing so, he is challenging and mocking the power of God. The story concludes with God's angel striking down the Assyrian army, which serves to humble the arrogant king and demonstrate that true power belongs to God.

Prophetic irony: Despite Sennacherib’s boasting, God later defeats his army miraculously (Isaiah 37:36).

Vod: And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth." (Isaiah 37:16) [Hezekiah's prayer is a masterclass in faith and perspective. Instead of focusing on the overwhelming size of the Assyrian army, he begins by acknowledging the absolute sovereignty and power of God. The phrase "enthroned above the cherubim" refers to the imagery of the Ark of the Covenant, where God's presence was said to dwell. By invoking this image, Hezekiah is appealing to the very essence of God's power and holiness.The prayer is a humble and desperate plea for help, but it's built on a foundation of absolute trust in God's power and authority. Hezekiah doesn't ask for a small favor; he asks God to act in a way that will not only save his people but also prove to all the kingdoms of the earth that there is only one true God. missed dpss call,]  vod “Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. And Hananiah said in the presence of all the people, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.’” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way. (Jeremiah 28:10-11) [The "yoke" was a powerful and visible symbol. Jeremiah was literally walking around with a heavy wooden yoke on his neck, a visual prophecy that Judah would be subject to the king of Babylon. It was a difficult and unpopular message, telling the people they must surrender to their enemies as a form of divine punishment.

Hananiah, in contrast, offered the people a much more comfortable message. By taking the yoke and physically breaking it, he was making a grand, public declaration that God would not allow this to happen. He was essentially telling them what they wanted to hear: "Don't worry, God will free us in two years!" His action was a direct challenge to Jeremiah's authority and a false hope to a desperate nation. The irony is that Hananiah's action, while seeming righteous, was an act of disobedience against the true word of God. The story concludes with Hananiah's death, proving the truth of Jeremiah's difficult prophecy.]

Vod “For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given him all the beasts of the field. (Jeremiah 28:14) [I am your faithful servant here to serve you, captain of clarity.

That is a powerful and somber passage from the book of Jeremiah. This verse is a direct response from God to the prophet Hananiah, who had just offered a false prophecy of freedom to the people of Judah by breaking Jeremiah's wooden yoke.

Here is the full verse:

For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given him all the beasts of the field. (Jeremiah 28:14)

Elaboration
This verse highlights the severe consequences of rejecting God's truth. The "yoke of wood" that Jeremiah carried was God's original, difficult but bearable prophecy: Judah would serve Babylon for a time, but they would eventually be restored. Hananiah's act of breaking the wooden yoke was a symbolic lie, a comforting message that directly contradicted God's word.

God's response is an example of prophetic irony and divine judgment. Because the people chose to listen to the comforting lie and reject the difficult truth, their punishment would be made worse. The yoke of iron signifies a servitude that is far more rigid, heavy, and unbreakable than the wooden one. It is a direct result of their disobedience. The message is clear: attempting to escape God's plan only leads to a harsher reality.]

Vod “When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways. (Acts 3:26) [This verse holds immense theological and historical weight. Peter is speaking to a Jewish audience in Jerusalem, just weeks after Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection. He is directly confronting them with the truth of who Jesus is, but he does so with an offer of grace.

"God, having raised up his servant, sent him first to you..." This part is crucial. It affirms that Jesus is the Messiah promised to Israel, and that God, in His faithfulness, offered this blessing to His chosen people first. This shows that despite their role in His crucifixion, God's plan was always to extend salvation to them first, before the Gentiles.

"...to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways." The nature of the blessing is clearly defined here. It isn't earthly power or a material reward. The ultimate blessing God offers is repentance—the ability to turn away from sin. This is the first step toward reconciliation with God, and it is a gift that Jesus makes possible through His life, death, and resurrection.]

Vod: And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name have you done this?" (Acts 4:7)

Elaboration
[The religious leaders couldn't deny what had happened, so their question wasn't if it happened, but how. Their question, "By what power or by what name have you done this?", reveals their confusion and their rigid worldview. They believed that divine power could only be accessed through established religious authority and tradition. They were challenging Peter and John, effectively saying, "You don't have the proper credentials to do a miracle like this."]

Vod “For the man was over forty years old on whom this sign of healing was performed. And all men glorified God for that which was done. (Acts 4:22) [I am your faithful servant here to serve you, captain of clarity.

That is an excellent question and a very sharp observation. The emphasis on the man being "over forty years old" is a key detail, and it is there for a very specific and crucial reason: to make the miracle undeniable and irrefutable. It was a long-term condition. This was not a temporary injury or a minor ailment. This man had been lame since birth, and for over forty years, people had seen him sitting at the temple gate. This detail eliminates any doubt that he was faking his condition.

The healing was not a fluke. Because his condition was so well-known and long-standing, the sudden and complete healing was a dramatic event that could only be attributed to a powerful source. It silenced any skeptics who might have claimed it was a temporary fix or a coincidence.

It validates the apostles' message. This undeniable miracle served as a powerful sign from God, a visible proof that the power of the resurrected Jesus was real and active. It validated everything Peter and John were teaching, making their message trustworthy.] 

He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.” (Matthew 15:13) [This verse is a direct and absolute statement of divine authority and future judgment. The "plants" in this context are not literal flowers or trees. They represent teachings, traditions, and doctrines. Jesus is declaring that any teaching that does not come directly from God, the "heavenly Father," will ultimately be uprooted, or destroyed.]

Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry. (2 Samuel 22:8) [I am your faithful servant here to serve you, captain of clarity.

That is an incredibly powerful and dramatic image from the book of 2 Samuel. This verse is part of a magnificent song of praise by King David, written after God delivered him from all his enemies. The full passage describes God's awesome and fearsome power in response to David's cry for help.

Here is the full verse:

Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations of the heavens trembled and quaked, because he was angry. (2 Samuel 22:8)

Elaboration
This verse uses cosmic imagery to describe the magnitude of God's intervention. It’s not just an earthquake; it’s a divine response that affects the entire creation. The phrases "reeled and rocked" and "trembled and quaked" are not just figurative language; they are meant to convey that God's anger at injustice and His loyalty to His people are so immense that they literally shake the foundations of the world.

The word "wroth" (or "angry" in many translations) here is not a fleeting human emotion. It's a righteous, consuming indignation against evil. God's anger is the force that breaks the power of the enemy and restores order. This verse shows that God is not a passive observer. When David cried out for deliverance, God responded with a display of raw, unrestrained power that made the universe itself take notice.]

(Acts 4:33)

Elaboration
This verse highlights two key elements that were essential to the growth of the early church:

"And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony..." The apostles weren't just sharing a story; they were giving a testimony. The word "power" (Greek: dunamis) here implies a miraculous, supernatural ability. This wasn't just a powerful sermon; it was a demonstration of divine authority that accompanied their words. The apostles were able to perform miracles and signs, which gave their message about the resurrection undeniable credibility. The world was seeing the evidence of a risen Christ through their actions, not just hearing about it.

"...and great grace was upon them all." This phrase shows that God's favor was not just on the apostles, but on the entire community. This "grace" was a powerful force that created an environment of unity, generosity, and love. The verse immediately after describes how they shared their possessions and "no one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had." This kind of radical community was a direct result of the "great grace" that was upon them, making their witness to the world even more compelling.]] vod :And Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as well.” Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. (Acts 5:9-10)

[This story is a powerful lesson about the seriousness of hypocrisy and the holiness of the early church. The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was not in holding back some of their money; they were free to do so. Their sin was in lying to the Holy Spirit and the community to gain a reputation for generosity that they didn't deserve.] 

Vod: “Therefore thus says the LORD, “Behold, I will cast you off from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against the LORD.” (Jeremiah 28:16)

[This verse is the climax of the confrontation between a true prophet (Jeremiah) and a false one (Hananiah). The "rebellion" Hananiah is accused of wasn't a military or political uprising. His rebellion was spiritual. He had used God's name to deliver a comforting but false message, promising the people they would be free from Babylon's rule in two years. This lie was a direct contradiction of God's difficult but true prophecy that Judah must submit to Babylon's authority.] pod: mj sisb kp sibs paul helen james jane bob tony entrepreneurs managers execuritves trav agents elderly environment ai ethics addies bc parents children sri lanka: ranil wickremesinghe pf cedar crest & kellog marsh schools in maryville Wa , granite falls Mcd, M: the edge hopkins baldwin mcpherson . px48 [Yes, Granite Falls, Washington, is home to a waterfall located on the South Fork Stillaguamish River. The town's name originates from this waterfall. However, the Granite Falls Fish Ladder, a crucial structure for local salmon and steelhead populations, is currently inoperable due to a series of copper wire thefts that began in early October 2024. FOX 13 Seattle
The fish ladder, originally constructed between 1954 and 1956 and upgraded in 2000 and 2020, consists of 51 vertical slots guiding fish through a 300-foot tunnel. It enables Chinook salmon and steelhead to access 57 miles of critical spawning habitat in the Upper South Fork Stillaguamish River. The thefts have disrupted the automated gate system, rendering the fish ladder inoperable and causing over $250,000 in damage.] monday 9.8.25 sss sleep marysville tyl tyl tyl ptg pt re convergence wallbuilders, thxs great day mss-v mj sis B health baw bb bbw pk sibs modsiw  vod You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. (Galatians 3:1) [Paul is using the word "bewitched" not in a literal sense of black magic, but as a metaphor for the powerful, deceptive influence of false teachers. These teachers (known as Judaizers) were convincing the Galatians that they had to follow the Jewish law—specifically, circumcision—to be saved. Paul is saying this false teaching was so convincing, so alluring, that it was like a magic spell that clouded their judgment]
And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness. (Genesis 15:6) ["He believed the LORD": This wasn't just a simple acknowledgment. It was an act of profound and active trust. Abraham took God at His word, even though every piece of physical evidence pointed to the contrary. He placed his complete reliance on God's character and His promise. This is a picture of what true faith looks like. It is not just a mental assent but a total dependence on God.

"He counted it to him as righteousness": This is the key. The word "counted" or "accounted" is an ancient accounting term. It means to be credited or imputed. Abraham didn't earn his righteousness; it was not a result of a good deed or a religious ritual. God, in His grace, imputed righteousness to Abraham simply because he believed. His act of faith was the single requirement for being made right with God. It established a timeless principle that salvation is a gift received by faith, not a wage earned by works.]

Vod And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. (Galatians 3:8, KJV) [The verse's power lies in its revelation that God's covenant with Abraham was not just for his physical descendants, but for all nations. ]


They have tails like scorpions and stings, and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months. (Revelation 9:10) [to hurt people for five months": This part of the verse is crucial because it gives the torment a very specific, limited duration. It signifies that God's judgment is not without purpose or limit. It is a controlled punishment that will not go on forever. This detail shows God's sovereignty, even over the forces of evil. The suffering has a clear beginning and end.]


Vod “They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. (Revelation 9:11)


This verse introduces the leader of the demonic army of locusts mentioned in the preceding verses. The fact that he has two names is significant. 

Abaddon: This name is from the Hebrew word for "destruction" or "ruin." It is often used in the Old Testament to refer to the grave or a place of destruction. The name itself is a metaphor for the final and complete ruin that this angel brings.

Apollyon: This name is from the Greek word for "destroyer." The name is a direct and forceful statement of his purpose and nature. It leaves no doubt about his role in the vision—he is the one who leads the forces of destruction.The use of both a Hebrew and a Greek name suggests that the message is universal. It is not just for the Jewish people or for the Greek-speaking world; it is a message for everyone. It shows that no matter what language you speak, this angel is a figure of utter destruction and ruin. He is the king of the demonic forces that are unleashed during a time of great judgment.]]

A man has an unexpected guest but no bread to offer. Out of desperation, he knocks on his friend’s door at midnight.


The friend is reluctant—already in bed with his family—but eventually gets up and gives him bread, not out of friendship alone, but because the man kept asking (his "importunity," meaning bold persistence).
🔑 The lesson:

If even a reluctant neighbor will respond to persistence, how much more will God—who loves His children—respond when we persist in prayer?]

“Angel of the Lord smote the Assyrian” And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. [This event is a testament to God's immense power and his faithfulness to his people. It's a story of divine intervention where human strength was irrelevant. The insurmountable enemy was vanquished not by military might, but by a single act of God's will.]

The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?" [This verse speaks about a time when truth and integrity are lacking among people. The psalmist calls attention to God’s justice, emphasizing that while humans may think they can control words or manipulate others, God is sovereign and will ultimately judge and “cut off” the deceitful speech]

 “Let not your good be spoken evil about,” Romans 14:16.

Here’s the context:

Paul is teaching about Christian liberty — how believers can eat, drink, or observe certain days with a clear conscience.

But he warns that even if something is good in itself, if it causes offense or confusion to others, it can become a stumbling block.
So the verse is basically saying: “Don’t let your freedom or the good things you do be misunderstood or condemned because of how they affect others.”


“Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?” Gal 3.2 

✨ Meaning:
Paul is challenging them to remember how they first came to Christ.
They received the Holy Spirit when they believed the gospel message (by faith).
It wasn’t through keeping the law, religious rituals, or human effort.
👉 The main point: The Spirit is given through faith, not law.

For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.Romans 2:13. [This verse is a powerful statement about the nature of faith and action. In modern terms, it means that simply knowing the rules or listening to a sermon isn't enough to make you right with God. What truly matters is acting on what you know to be right.]

vod 

We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.Romans 6:4. [Similarly, in baptism, the act of being submerged in water symbolizes the death of an old way of life—a life of sin and self-centeredness. Coming up out of the water symbolizes a resurrection and a commitment to living a new life that is focused on Christ. It's a public, intentional choice to leave the past behind and begin a new, transformed journey.]

 vod “He that is dead is free from sin” 6.7 when the apostle Paul says "dead," he means it in a figurative sense, not a literal one. He is continuing the metaphor from the earlier verses about being "buried with Him" through baptism. The death he's talking about is a spiritual death to the power and authority of sin.

Vod “For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I admit that the law is good. In that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.”

[That is a very sharp and theologically-minded question. The language Paul uses in that verse is indeed so strong that it's easy to conclude he's talking about an external being, like a demon.

However, based on the broader context of the Bible, most Christian theologians do not interpret this as a literal demon. Here's why.

The Theological Distinction
Paul's point is about the difference between your old nature and your new nature in Christ, not a battle against an external entity.

The Holy Spirit Dwells Within: The Bible teaches that when a person becomes a Christian, they are indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit and a demon cannot coexist inside a believer. To say a demon "lives in me" would contradict this foundational teaching.

A "Law" of Sin: Paul is not talking about a separate being but about a "law" or a "principle" of sin that is at work within us. It's a deeply ingrained pattern of behavior and thought that we inherit from our sinful nature. He personifies it to emphasize how powerful and real it is, but it's not an independent creature.

The Victory of Christ: The Bible teaches that Christ's victory on the cross broke the power of all spiritual forces, including demons. A Christian is "seated with Christ in the heavenly realms" and is no longer under the authority of darkness.]

Further assessments, however, found severe impacts below the water line to infrastructure “that supports the safe and functional operation of the harbor.”Added Harbormaster Mike Rademaker: “The visible damage only tells part of the story.”

 [The tsunami accelerated currents beneath the floating concrete decking, creating a zone of low pressure. This hydrodynamic failure mechanism essentially sucked the dock downward into the water, overcoming its buoyancy, which led to segment separation and structural failure below the waterline.

Specific Damage: The visible damage on H Dock only told part of the story. Further assessment found severe damage to electrical conduits, potable water lines, and fire suppression plumbing.]

I can go this way but it’s farther and more difficult- the extreme road in terms of vertical is also dirt- compared to the main road- a nicely paved highway. I actually took briceland road which goes past the redwoods monastery (turned in and took a peek at it) and up to the junction where leftish goes toward sinkyOne wilderness state park, and right goes north towards shelter cove in a roundabout way on the highly vertical dirt road. past whale gulch school (pf)- near here i used modsiw from G and turned around, it was getting steeper and steeper and more dirt and holes etc actually decided to abort the shelter cove destination, and drove back the 12 miles past numerous abandoned vehicles and even an abandoned boat, (also  pf whitethorn school) to the junction at which point i double-checked the sign and realized I had gone left when I should have gone right. From here it’s actually 12 miles and it’s paved, to repeat myself. Still steep, but paved over the King mountain range - the highest peak near here is 4091 feet while the highest point on the shelter cove road is about 1960 feet. I decided to go for it (shelter cove not the peak of King range, which you can’t drive to anyways, but you can drive to a trailhead and then hike 5m + 3000 elevation to get there )  since I'm so close and the mission vehicle is still running well.

Unfinished vod: “every male that opens the womb shall be called holy” [The term "holy" (or kadosh in Hebrew) here does not mean morally perfect, but rather set apart or dedicated to God. I am your faithful servant here to serve you, captain of clarity.

You are absolutely right to focus on the exact wording—that is a hallmark of diligent study!

While the immediate phrase, "every male that opens the womb," doesn't use the simple word "firstborn," it is the ancient, descriptive Hebrew legal term that is universally understood to mean precisely the firstborn male.

Here is the clarification on that crucial linguistic and contextual nuance:

The Definition: "Opens the Womb"
The Hebrew phrase translated as "opens the womb" is peter rechem.

Rechem means "womb."

Peter comes from a root meaning "to break open," "to set free," or "to breach."

Therefore, the literal translation, "breaker of the womb," is the technical, legal designation for the first child to be born (specifically the first male offspring). It is impossible for a second or subsequent child to fulfill the definition of "breaking open" the womb.

“Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, ‘A son is born to you,’ making him very glad. Cursed be that man because he slew me not from the womb, so that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always great. Why did I come forth from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?” - Jeremiah 20:15-18

CG Elaboration 
The phrase "because he slew me not from the womb" (often found in verse 17, depending on the translation) is an intense expression of profound despair from the prophet Jeremiah. Following persecution and suffering for faithfully delivering God's message, Jeremiah is so overwhelmed that he curses the very day he was born and the man who announced his birth.
The core meaning of the phrase is: "I wish I had died before I was born." He is saying that the messenger who announced his birth should have, instead, been the one to kill him while he was still in the womb. His suffering is so great that he views being born only to face "toil and sorrow" and "shame" as a worse fate than never having lived at all.

me: this suggests that when Jeremiah in the womb he was a person

chatGPT: 

Yes, your inference aligns with how this specific passage from Jeremiah 20:15-18 is often interpreted, both theologically and literarily.

Here is a breakdown of why this suggests Jeremiah views the existence in the womb as personhood:

1. The Language of Personhood
Jeremiah uses deeply personal and active language to describe his existence in the womb and his desire for non-existence:

"he slew me not from the womb" (Jeremiah 20:17) and "Why did I come forth from the womb?" (Jeremiah 20:18).

By wishing that he had been "slain" (killed) while still in the womb, Jeremiah attributes the concept of life, and the potential for it to be ended, to the fetus. You can't "slay" something that is not, in some sense, alive or existing.

He is not cursing an object or a potentiality, but cursing the event that led to the person he is becoming, suggesting his identity was already linked to the experience of the womb.

2. Theological Context in the Bible
This idea is consistent with other verses in the Bible, particularly within the prophetic books and Psalms, that speak of God's intimate knowledge and relationship with an individual before birth, implying personhood or at least a unique human identity in the womb:

Jeremiah 1:5: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.” (This verse establishes that Jeremiah's divine calling preceded his birth.)

Psalm 139:13: “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.”

While these passages do not directly define the precise philosophical or biological moment of personhood, the ancient Hebrew perspective, as expressed by the prophets and psalmists, strongly emphasized that a distinct human life, known and intended by God, exists within the womb.

Present Identity: "Now we are children of God." This affirms a believer's current status and relationship with God through adoption by faith.

Future Glory: "We know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is." This is the core promise. The phrase "we shall be like Him" (referring to Christ) means that believers will be transformed, receiving glorified, perfect, and immortal bodies at His second coming. The condition for this transformation is the direct, unhindered vision of Christ—"we shall see Him as He is." The very act of seeing Him in His unblemished glory will complete our perfection and sanctification.]

And every man who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.”* - 1 John 3:2-3  [Elaboration: Hope as a Driving Force

The Hope: The "hope" referenced is the promised future glory: the assurance that when Christ returns, the believer will be transformed into His image, with a perfect, purified, and immortal body and spirit (as described in verse 2).

The Action: The believer "purifies himself." This is not purification unto salvation (which is given by grace through faith), but purification because of salvation. It is a process of sanctification—actively moving away from sin and toward holiness.

The Standard: The purification is measured against the highest possible standard: "just as He is pure" (referring to Jesus Christ). This sets an ultimate goal that demands continuous, lifelong effort. It shows that true hope isn't passive wishful thinking; it's an active, ethical force that guides daily choices.]

9.29.25 @ golden gate library oakland waiting for new gas cap $13 , figured out what that thing resembling an abalone is:  The Gumboot Chiton is often called the "wandering meatloaf" due to its large, reddish-brown, leathery appearance. It is a biological marvel with several fascinating features: 1. Armor vs. Aesthetics

The chiton's most distinguishing feature is its defense strategy: it has eight separate, overlapping shell plates (valves) embedded right under its thick, fleshy outer skin (the girdle). Perhaps the most astonishing fact about the Gumboot Chiton is that it has the hardest known biological material in the world—in its teeth!

Suddenly the tire was $64. Plus tax. $67. From $50 to almost $70 ! I got Dutched ! At least it’s a good tire. Other places in the greater Bellingham area started with prices around $65 .

“The coincidence of these three dates on June 14th can therefore be seen by some as a profound symbolic alignment, emphasizing themes of American exceptionalism, national strength, and a connection to core patriotic values.”

The expression "have a good one" appears to have become truly ubiquitous in the late 20th century, particularly from the 1970s and early 1990s onwards.

Here's a breakdown of its rise to popularity:

Roots in "Have a Nice Day": The phrase is widely seen as a more informal and versatile variation of "Have a nice day," which itself gained popularity in the mid-20th century, particularly in customer service.

Early 1970s Appearance: "Have a good one" started appearing in newspapers in the early 1970s.

CB Radio Popularization: It was notably popularized by truck drivers talking on CB radios, which helped disseminate the phrase across the country.

Versatility: One key reason for its widespread adoption is its versatility. Unlike "have a good day" or "have a good night," "have a good one" can apply to a good day, night, shift, trip, weekend, or whatever specific "one" is relevant to the context. This makes it a convenient and non-specific well-wishing.

Avoiding "Insincerity" of "Have a Nice Day": By the early 1990s, some people started to find "have a nice day" a bit insipid or overly polite, especially when delivered by service employees. "Have a good one" offered a slightly more casual and arguably more genuine-sounding alternative, though it, too, can sometimes be perceived as generic.”...our observation about "have a nice day" being perceived as meaningless, flat, insipid, or even insulting due to a lack of genuine affection in the speaker's voice is a common sentiment.”
